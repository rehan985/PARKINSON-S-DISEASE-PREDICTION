# PARKINSON'S DISEASE PREDICTION DJANGO APP

- This project proposes a hybrid architecture with voice and spiral drawing dataset information analysis to predict Parkinson’s  disease in an easy manner. 
- It features an easy to use GUI which is built using Django. 
- We will propose a hybrid architecture with voice and spiral drawing dataset information analysis to predict Parkinson’s  disease in an easy manner.
- Parkinson’s disease is a dynamic neurodegenerative disorder influencing over 6 million people
worldwide. However there is no recognized test for PD for patients, particularly in the early stages. This results in increased mortality rate. Thus detection system of Parkinson’s disease with easy steps and
feasible one to detect parkinson’s disease at the early stage is essential. 
- The project is based on the research paper: "MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUE BASED PARKINSON’S DISEASE DETECTION FROM SPIRAL AND VOICE INPUTS". The link for the paper is:
